## Bowling Scoring Basics

### Strike (X)
- Knock down all 10 pins on the **first roll**
- Score: 10 + next 2 rolls

### Spare (/)
- Knock down all 10 pins using **both rolls**
- Score: 10 + next 1 roll

### 10th Frame Special Rules
- If you get a **strike**, you get **2 bonus rolls**
- If you get a **spare**, you get **1 bonus roll**
- Maximum score per frame: 30 (three strikes)
- Perfect game: 300 points

## Keyboard Shortcuts

While the application is focused:
- `0-9` keys work (if implemented)
- `Esc` to cancel dialogs

## Troubleshooting

### Application won't start
```bash
# Make sure all dependencies are installed
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### Database errors
Delete the database file and restart (this will erase all data):
```bash
# Windows
del bowling_tracker.db

# macOS/Linux  
rm bowling_tracker.db
```

### Missing animations
Animations are optional! The app uses emoji fallbacks if GIF files aren't present. To add GIFs:
1. Download bowling GIFs
2. Save as `assets/animations/strike.gif` and `assets/animations/spare.gif`

### Qt Platform Plugin Error
On some systems, you may need to install additional Qt dependencies:

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install pyqt5
```

## Tips & Tricks

### üí° Scoring Strategies
- Focus on **consistency** over power
- **Spares are more valuable** than you think (they're easier than strikes!)
- The **10th frame** can make or break your score

### üìä Using Statistics
- Track your **progress over time** with the performance chart
- Set goals based on your **average score**
- Watch your **strike percentage** improve with practice

### üéÆ Game Management
- Use **Rematch** to quickly start a new game with the same players
- **Search** in Player Management to find specific players quickly
- The database **automatically saves** all game data

## Sample Workflow

Here's a typical session:

```
1. Launch app
2. Add players: "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"
3. Start new game, select all 3 players
4. Play the game (entering scores)
   - Alice: Frame 1 ‚Üí 7, 2 (9 pins)
   - Bob: Frame 1 ‚Üí 10 (Strike! üí•)
   - Charlie: Frame 1 ‚Üí 8, 2 (Spare! ‚ú®)
   - Continue through all 10 frames...
5. Game over! Bob wins with 215
6. Click "Rematch" for another round
