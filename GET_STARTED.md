## 📊 Database Schema

Your application uses a professional SQLite database with 3 tables:

### Player Table
```sql
- player_id (Primary Key)
- player_name (Unique)
- date_joined
```

### Game Table
```sql
- game_id (Primary Key)
- player_id (Foreign Key)
- final_score
- game_date
```

### Frame Table
```sql
- frame_id (Primary Key)
- game_id (Foreign Key)
- frame_number (1-10)
- roll1_pins
- roll2_pins
- roll3_pins (10th frame only)
```

---

## 🎯 Key Features Explained

### Bowling Scoring Rules (Implemented!)

**Strike (X)** - All 10 pins on first roll
- Score = 10 + next 2 rolls

**Spare (/)** - All 10 pins in 2 rolls
- Score = 10 + next 1 roll

**10th Frame** - Special rules
- Strike → 2 bonus rolls
- Spare → 1 bonus roll
- Max score: 30 per frame

**Perfect Game** = 300 points (12 strikes)
